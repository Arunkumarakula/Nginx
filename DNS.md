DNS (Domain Name System) is a distributed system that translates human-readable domain names like  
**www.google.com**  
into machine-readable IP addresses like  
**142.250.190.78**.

#  **DNS Resolution Components**

When you try to access a domain like **www.example.com**, DNS resolution involves four major systems:

---

## **1. DNS Recursor (Recursive Resolver)**

* This is the first server your device contacts (usually provided by your ISP, Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS, etc.).
* It **receives the DNS query** from your device and is responsible for finding the IP address of the domain.
* If the answer is not cached, it performs multiple queries to other DNS servers (root, TLD, authoritative).

**Think of it as:**  
*The DNS “agent” that does all the lookup work on your behalf.*

---

## **2. Root Nameserver**

* One of the highest-level DNS servers in the internet hierarchy.
* There are only **13 sets** of root servers worldwide.
* The root server does **NOT** know the final IP address—but it directs the resolver to the appropriate **TLD nameserver** (e.g., .com, .org, .net).

**Example:**  
Resolver asks: “Where is example.com?”  
Root replies: “Go ask the **.com TLD server**.”

---

## **3. TLD Nameserver (Top-Level Domain)**

* TLD servers manage top-level domains such as **.com, .org, .net, .in, .edu**.
* The TLD server does not contain the actual IP address but tells the resolver **which authoritative nameserver** is responsible for the specific domain.

**Example:**  
TLD server says:  
“example.com is handled by the authoritative nameserver at ns1.exampledns.com.”

---

## **4. Authoritative Nameserver**

* This server holds the **real DNS records** for the domain.
* It provides the final answer: the **IP address** (A record), or other DNS records like CNAME, MX, TXT.

**Example:**  
Query: “What is the IP of www.example.com?”  
Authoritative server replies: **93.184.216.34**

This is the **end of the DNS lookup**, and the resolver returns the result to your device.

# 🎯 **Final Interview-Ready Summary**

“In DNS resolution, the DNS recursor receives the user’s DNS request and queries higher-level servers to find the domain’s IP. The root nameserver directs it to the appropriate TLD nameserver based on the domain extension. The TLD nameserver then directs the resolver to the domain’s authoritative nameserver, which finally provides the actual IP address. This IP is returned to the client so it can connect to the web server.”
